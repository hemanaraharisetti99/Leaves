Compressed (Artificial) wood has found its primary application in the creation of interior components that are typically concealed from view due to their rough appearance. Derived from wood scraps, this synthetic alternative has significantly transformed the field of carpentry since its introduction in the 19th century. Today, approximately 80% of products on the market are composed of a combination of artificial and real wood. Various materials such as chipboards, high, medium, and low-density fibre, and wood-oriented standard wood are utilized in the production of artificial wood. In this project, dry mango leaf scraps were used as a substitute for traditional wood debris, highlighting the versatility of this material. This article explores the design concept, fabrication process, features, and potential applications of bio inspired artificial wood, which mimics the cellular structures and mechanical properties of natural wood. Additionally, it discusses the current challenges and future research directions aimed at advancing artificial wood technology. To achieve a truly eco-friendly artificial wood, there is a growing need for the development of biomaterials and engineering polymers that are both bio degradable or recyclable and possess high mechanical properties and environmental sustainability. This underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to innovate and improve the sustainability of artificial wood materials.
